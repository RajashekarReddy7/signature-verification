**‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:**
1.	**Data Upload:** Users upload signature images through the frontend interface.
2.	**Preprocessing:** Signature images undergo preprocessing using OpenCV to enhance clarity and normalize dimensions.
3.	**Deep Learning Prediction:**

    o	The pre-processed signature is fed into a trained CNN model.

  	o	The model analyses geometric and statistical features to classify the signature as **Genuine** or **Forged**.
5.	**Results Visualization:** The frontend displays the results, helping users understand the verification outcome.
6.	**Data Logging:** Signature data and results are stored in MongoDB for auditing and future references.
